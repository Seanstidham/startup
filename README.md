# the initial design for my project is a website roulette game, with an score that increments based on how spins/rounds you go in the game. If you lose the roulette game, the game will blacklist your username/email making it so you can only view the scoreboard after you lose.
# idea uses authentication through email
# scoreboard where you can see other's scores + live feed of users losing
# multiple tabs for cleaner UI on both mobile and pc view
